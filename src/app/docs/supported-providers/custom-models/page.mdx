## Configuring Custom Models

Often you may want to use a custom model with an existing provider, for example if you're using a self-hosted model exposed via the OpenAI API.
Or if you're using a proxy to the OpenAI API.

We require certain information about any model to be able to use it. We ship with a default set of models, but you can also add custom models.

The example below will add an API key, but given that this is a custom provider, the key is optional.

1. Create a Kubernetes Secret that stores the API key, replace `<your_api_key>` with an actual API key:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
kubectl create secret generic kagent-openai -n kagent --from-literal OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY
```

2. Create a ModelConfig resource that references the secret and key name, and specify the model you want to use:

```yaml
apiVersion: kagent.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ModelConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-openai-model-config
  namespace: kagent
spec:
  apiKeySecretRef: kagent-openai
  apiKeySecretKey: OPENAI_API_KEY
  model: <insert-model-name> # This should match the model name passed to the provider.
  provider: OpenAI
  openai:
    baseUrl: https://your-custom-openai-provider.com
  modelInfo:
    functionCalling: true
    family: unknown
```

If you don't need an API key you can elide the `apiKeySecretRef` and `apiKeySecretKey` fields.

3. Apply the above resource to the cluster.

Once the resource is applied, you can select the model from the Model dropdown in the UI when creating or updating agents.
