# Quick Start

This guide will help you get started with [kagent](https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent), an open-source framework that brings the power of agentic AI to cloud-native environments. We'll walk through setting environment and deploying your first AI agent.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for creating and running a local Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - for installing the kagent chart
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - for interacting with your cluster

To run the AI agents you'll also need an [OpenAI](https://openai.com) API key. You can [get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Installing kagent

1. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

2. Download the kagent CLI:

```bash
# Download/run the install script
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kagent-dev/kagent/refs/heads/main/scripts/get-kagent | bash
```

3. Install kagent to the cluster using the CLI. First run the CLI:

```bash
kagent
```

Then, once within the CLI environment, run the install command:

```bash
install
```

```console
kagent >> install
kagent installed successfully
```

## Accessing the kagent dashboard (UI)

1. To open the kagent dashboard, run the dashboard command from the CLI

```bash
kagent >> dashboard
kagent dashboard is available at http://localhost:8082
Press Enter to stop the port-forward...
```

The CLI will set up the port-forward to the service running inside the cluster and open the dashboard.

## Running Your First AI Agent

Once you're in the kagent UI, you can start interacting with the pre-configured sample agents. You can click on the agent card to view the agent details and start a conversation.

## Using the CLI

You can run *kagent* to start the REPL environment and then use commands to interact with kagent:

```shell
kagent >> help

Commands:
  clear          clear the screen
  dashboard      Open the kagent dashboard.
  exit           exit the program
  get            get kagent resources.
  help           display help
  install        Install kagent.
  run            Run a kagent agent
  uninstall      Uninstall kagent.
  version        Print the kagent version.
```

Let's start by listing the current agents:

```shell
kagent >> get agents
kagent >> get agents
+---+---------------------+----+----------------------------+
| # | NAME                | ID | CREATED                    |
+---+---------------------+----+----------------------------+
| 0 | helm-agent          | 2  | 2025-03-13T19:08:14.527935 |
| 1 | observability-agent | 3  | 2025-03-13T19:08:14.348957 |
| 2 | istio-agent         | 1  | 2025-03-13T19:08:13.794848 |
+---+---------------------+----+----------------------------+
```

To start a new agent, run the `run chat` command:

```shell
kagent >> run chat [agent-name] [session-name] [initial-task]
```
If you don't provide any flags, it will it will prompt you for the values:

```shell
kagent >> run chat

Select an agent:
   observability-agent
   istio-agent
 ❯ helm-agent

Select a session:
 ❯ [New Session]
Enter a session name: test
Enter a task: What helm chart are installed in my cluster?
```

Once a task has been entered, the agent will start running and you'll see the conversation in the CLI:

```shell
Event Type: ToolCall(s)
Source: helm_agent
+---+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| # | NAME               | ARGUMENTS                               |
+---+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 0 | helm_list_releases | {"all_namespaces":true,"deployed":true} |
+---+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
----------------------------------

Event Type: TextMessage
Source: helm_agent

I found the following Helm release deployed across all namespaces:

- **Release Name:** kagent
  - **Namespace:** kagent
  - **Revision:** 11
  - **Updated:** 2025-03-13 19:18:49 UTC
  - **Status:** Deployed
  - **Chart:** kagent-v0.0.18-4-g4926e59-dirty

If you need more details about any specific release, let me know!
----------------------------------

Usage: Prompt Tokens: 6573, Completion Tokens: 229
helm-agent--test>
```

As you can see above, the agent found the `kagent` release. If anything else is running in your cluster, it will probably find that too.

Now keep chatting with the agent to see what other things it can do :)
