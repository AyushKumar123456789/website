# Quick Start

This guide will help you get started with [kagent](https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent), an open-source framework that brings the power of agentic AI to cloud-native environments. We'll walk through setting environment and deploying your first AI agent.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for creating and running a local Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - for installing the kagent chart
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - for interacting with your cluster

To run the AI agents you'll also need an [OpenAI](https://openai.com) API key. You can [get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Installing kagent

1. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

2. Download the kagent CLI:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent/releases/download/v0.0.12/kagent-darwin-arm64
mv kagent-darwin-arm64 kagent
chmod +x kagent
sudo mv kagent /usr/local/bin/kagent
```
</div>

<div id="windows-tab">
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent/releases/latest/download/kagent_windows_amd64.zip -OutFile kagent.zip
Expand-Archive -Path kagent.zip -DestinationPath .\kagent
Move-Item .\kagent\kagent.exe C:\Windows\System32\
```
</div>

<div id="linux-tab">
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent/releases/latest/download/kagent_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf kagent_linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv kagent /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kagent
```
</div>


3. Install kagent to the cluster using the CLI. First run the CLI:

```bash
kagent
```

Then, once within the CLI environment, run the install command:

```bash
install
```

```console
kagent >> install
kagent installed successfully
```

## Using the CLI

You can run *kagent* to start the REPL environment and then use commands to interact with kagent:

```shell
kagent >> help

Commands:
  clear          clear the screen
  dashboard      Open the kagent dashboard.
  exit           exit the program
  get            get kagent resources.
  help           display help
  install        Install kagent.
  run            Run a kagent agent
  uninstall      Uninstall kagent.
  version        Print the kagent version.
```

## Accessing the kagent dashboard (UI)

1. To open the kagent dashboard, run the dashboard command from the CLI

```
kagent >> dashboard
kagent dashboard is available at http://localhost:8082
Press Enter to stop the port-forward...
```

The CLI will set up the port-forward to the service running inside the cluster and open the dashboard.
