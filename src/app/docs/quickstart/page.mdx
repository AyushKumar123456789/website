# Quick Start

This guide will help you get started with kagent, an open-source framework that brings the power of agentic AI to cloud-native environments. We'll walk through setting up a local development environment and deploying your first AI agent.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) - for creating a local Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - for installing kagent
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - for interacting with your cluster

To run agents you'll also nee an OpenAI API key. You can [get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Installing kagent

1. Add the Kagent Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add kagent https://kagent.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```


1. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

1. Install kagent using Helm:

```bash
helm install kagent kagent/kagent \
    --namespace kagent \
    --create-namespace \
    --set openai.apiKey=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
```


## Accessing the kagent UI

1. Forward the Kagent UI port to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/kagent-app 8080:80
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Running Your First AI Agent

Once you're in the Kagent UI, you can start interacting with the pre-configured agents. You can click on the agent card to view the agent details and start a conversation.

The agent will help you manage and understand your Kubernetes resources using natural language.
