# Tools

Tools are functions that the agent can use to interact with its environment. For example, a Kubernetes agent might have tools to list pods, get pod logs, and describe services.

Kagent comes with a set of built-in tools that you can use to interact with your environment. Kagent also supports the MCP (Model Configuration Protocol) tools. Using MCP, you can bring any external tool into kagent and make it available for your agents to run.

## Built-in Tools
