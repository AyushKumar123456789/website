# kagent Architecture

Kagent consists of multiple components running inside and outside of Kubernetes cluster.

## Controller

The kagent controller is a Kubernetes controller, written in Go, that knows how to handle custom CRDs for creating and managing AI agents in the cluster. 

In the future, we envision more features for the controller, such as:
- Native MCP server for our built-in tools

## App/Engine

The kagent engine is the core component of kagent. It is a Python application that is responsible for running the agent's conversation loop. It is built on top of the [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) framework. Currently, we are running the autogenstudio backend, but likely in the near future we will switch to running our own backend as the use-cases begin to diverge.

The autogen team did a wonderful job of creating a flexible, powerful, and most importantly extensible framework for building AI agents. We take full advantage of this by using the framework by adding our own `Teams`, `Agents`, and `Tools`.

Please see the following links for more information on the AutoGen framework:

## CLI

Kagent CLI is one of the entry points to kagent. The CLI connects to the engine and allows you to manage resources and interact with agents.

The CLI offers a way to interact with the engine for those who prefer a CLI interface to the UI dashboard.


## Dashboard (UI)

Kagent dashboard provides a web interface for managing and working with AI agents. Is it the simplest way to get started with kagent.
