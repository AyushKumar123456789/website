# Quickstart

Install the KMCP CLI and quickly spin up your first FastMCP Python server. 

## Prerequisites

- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to run FastMCP servers.
- Install the MCP Inspector tool to test access to your MCP server. 
  ```sh
  npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
  ```

## Install the KMCP CLI

1. Download the KMCP CLI from the [release page](https://github.com/kagent-dev/kmcp/releases). To find the operating system and system architecture for which you need to download the CLI, run the following commands. 
   ```sh
   OS=$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' )
   ARCH=$(uname -m )
   echo $OS
   echo $ARCH
   ``` 

2. Install the KMCP CLI. 
   ```sh
   chmod +x kmcp-$OS-$ARCH
   mv kmcp-$OS-$ARCH kmcp
   sudo mv kmcp /usr/local/bin 
   export PATH=$HOME/.kmcp/bin:$PATH
   ```

3. Verify that the KMCP CLI is installed. 
   ```sh
   kmcp --help
   ```
 
## Spin up your first MCP server

1. Create a scaffold for your FastMCP Python server project in the `my-mcp-server` directory. The scaffold includes all the files and dependencies to spin up the MCP server with a sample `echo` tool. 

   **Tip:** Want to use a different MCP framework instead? Try out [MCP Go](/docs/kmcp/develop/mcp-go).
   
   ```sh
   kmcp init python my-mcp-server
   ```
   
2. Run your MCP server on your local machine. The command builds the Docker image for your MCP server and automatically opens the MCP inspector tool so that you can connect to your MCP server and test it.
   ```sh
   kmcp run --project-dir my-mcp-server
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```sh
   Starting MCP inspector...
   ‚öôÔ∏è Proxy server listening on localhost:6277
   üîë Session token: 39359f4867a366abc8ecdf5daa243d547d4f61a43e207cc1adbdc23ae47550f8
      Use this token to authenticate requests or set DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true to disable auth

   üöÄ MCP Inspector is up and running at:
      http://localhost:6274/?MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=39359f4867a366abc8ecdf5daa243d547d4f61a43e207cc1adbdc23ae47550f8
   ```
   
3. In the MCP inspector tool, click **Connect** to connect to your MCP server. Note that it might take a few seconds for the MCP inspector tool to successfully connect to your MCP server. If the connection fails, make sure the following fields are set in the MCP inspector tool. 
   * Select **STDIO** from the **Transport Type** drop down. 
   * In the **Command** field, enter `uv`. 
   * In the **Arguments** field, enter `run python src/main.py`. 
   * In the **Configuration** section, enter the session token from the previous command output in the **Proxy Session Token** field.

4. Try out the `echo` MCP tool. 
   1. Go to the **Tools** tab and click **List Tools**. 
   2. Select the `echo` tool. 
   3. Enter any string in the **message** field, such as `Hello world` and click **Run Tool**. 
   4. Verify that you see your message echoed in the **Tool result** card.

Congratulations, you successfully developed your first MCP server with KMCP!
