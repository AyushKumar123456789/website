# `kmcp run`

Run an MCP server on your local machine by using the Model Context Protocol inspector tool. 

**Note**: If you do not have the MCP inspector tool installed, run `npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`. 

```bash
kmcp run [flags]
```

**Flags:**
- `--project-dir, -d` - Project directory to use (default: current directory)
- `--verbose, -v` - Show detailed output

## Example

The following command runs the MCP server that is defined in the `my-mcp-server` project on your local machine. 
The command automatically builds the Docker image for your MCP server and opens the MCP inspector tool so that you can connect to your server. 

```sh
kmcp run --project-dir my-mcp-server
```

To learn how to use the MCP inspector tool to connect to an MCP server, check out the [FastMCP Python](/docs/kmcp/develop/fastmcp-python) or [MCP Go](/docs/kmcp/develop/mcp-go) guide.
