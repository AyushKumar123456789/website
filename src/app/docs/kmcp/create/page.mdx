# Develop MCP servers


1. Create a scaffold for your MCP server project. 
   Follow the interactive CLI prompts to select the MCP framework that you want to use, and optionally add the author's name and email address that you want to associate with the project. Currently, FastMCP Python is the only supported framework. For more information, see the [FastMCP docs](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp). 
   
   The following command creates a `my-mcp-server` directory that includes a sample MCP server and a default echo tool that you can use to later test your server. 
   ```sh
   kmcp init my-mcp-server 
   ```
   
2. Review the project structure that was created for you. 
   ```sh
   cd my-mcp-server
   ```
   
   Example project structure
   ```sh
   ├── src/
   │   ├── tools/          # Tool implementations
   │   ├── resources/      # Resource handlers
   │   ├── prompts/        # Prompt templates
   │   └── main.py         # MCP server entry point
   ├── tests/              # Built-in test suite
   ├── Dockerfile          # Container definition for spinning up your MCP server
   ├── kmcp.yaml           # Container definition for spinning up your MCP server
   ├── pyproject.toml      # Python dependencies
   ├── .env.example        # Environment variables
   └── README.md           # MCP Project documentation
   ```



KMCP is a comprehensive platform for creating, developing and deploying Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. 

## About MCP

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how Large Language Model (LLM) applications connect to various external data sources and tools. Without MCP, you need to implement custom integrations for each tool that your LLM application needs to access. However, this approach is hard to maintain and can cause issues when you want to scale your environment. With MCP, you can significantly speed up, simplify, and standardize these types of integrations. An MCP server exposes external data sources and tools so that LLM applications can access them. 

## About KMCP

KMCP provides a powerful CLI tool with built-in boilerplates to speed up the local development of MCP servers and MCP tools. Once developed, you can leverage the KMCP control plane to quickly spin up and deploy your MCP servers in your cloud-native environment, such as Kubernetes.
