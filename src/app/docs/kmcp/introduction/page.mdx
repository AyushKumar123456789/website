# Introduction

KMCP is a comprehensive platform to accelerate the local development of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and manage their lifecycle in cloud-native environments, such as Kubernetes. 

## About MCP

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how Large Language Model (LLM) applications connect to various external data sources and tools. Without MCP, you need to implement custom integrations for each tool that your LLM application needs to access. However, this approach is hard to maintain and can cause issues when you want to scale your environment. With MCP, you can significantly speed up, simplify, and standardize these types of integrations. An MCP server exposes external data sources and tools so that LLM applications can access them. 

## What is KMCP?

KMCP provides a powerful CLI tool with built-in boilerplates to speed up the local development of MCP servers and MCP tools. Once developed, you can leverage the KMCP control plane to quickly spin up and deploy your MCP servers in your cloud-native environment, such as Kubernetes.  

With KMCP, you can: 
* Quickly initialize an MCP project for various MCP frameworks that follows industry best practices for developing MCP servers and tools. 
* Access built-in boilerplates to accelerate the development and deployment of MCP tools. 
* Automatically manage the lifecycle of MCP servers in cloud-native environments, such as Kubernetes. 
* Manage secrets for MCP servers in Kubernetes.
