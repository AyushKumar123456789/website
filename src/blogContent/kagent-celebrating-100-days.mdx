When we first [introduced kagent](https://techstrong.ai/agentic-ai/solo-ios-kagent-brings-agentic-ai-to-cloud-native-operations/) on March 17th, 2025, we had a bold vision: to bring agentic AI to cloud native—empowering platforms and DevOps engineers to harness AI agents for solving real operational challenges.

Fast forward 100 days, and today we’re celebrating a major milestone: **100 days of the kagent project**! 🎉Thank you everyone for being part of this journey! 🚀

## Accepted into CNCF as a sandbox project

What began as a tool to address our own customer challenges has grown into a thriving open-source project. Kagent is now a **CNCF Sandbox project**, and it's evolving into a powerful **declarative agentic AI framework**—enabling like-minded engineers to run AI agents in Kubernetes, automating complex operations and streamlining troubleshooting workflows.

## 🌟 100 contributors & 1000+ GitHub stars!

In just 100 days, Kagent has hit two incredible milestones:
- 🚀 100+ contributors, with over **85% from outside Solo.io**
- ⭐ **1000+ GitHub stars** from our amazing community!

We’ve been actively connecting with contributors through GitHub, Discord, weekly community calls, livestreams, and Contributor Spotlights. We’re incredibly grateful for everyone who’s explored, supported, and contributed to kagent.

A **huge shoutout** to our top 20 contributors, and a special thanks to our top 3: @eitanya, @peterj, and @sbx03 — your dedication and impact have been phenomenal! 🙌

## Users Advocating for Kagent

Over the past 100 days, we've been blown away by how our early adopters are using kagent in creative and powerful ways—including in **production environments**! Across social media, community meetings, and beyond, users are not just experimenting—they're innovating. 💡
Here are just a few examples of how the community is putting Kagent to work:

## 🌍 Kagent Travels Around the World

In just 100 days, kagent has made its mark on the global stage. We’ve taken our vision of Agentic AI to some of the most prestigious conferences worldwide—sharing our belief that kagent is a key building block for the future of agentic AI.

### 📢KubeCon EU 2025
This was where it all began—the first public announcement of kagent and our intention to donate it to the CNCF. The announcement was made during the Day 2 keynote by Idit Levine and Keith Babo. Later, Christian Posta delivered a live demo at the KubeCon EU demo theater, showcasing kagent in action. 🚀

### 🇫🇷 GOSIM AI Paris 2025
Eitan Yarmush took the stage in Paris to challenge attendees to rethink the open-source agent stack with Kagent. Check out the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uus0zf6OUQ)—it’s a must-watch!

### 🤠 KCD Texas 2025
Kagent was featured in KCD Texas keynote along with Headlamp, AI model pack and Dapr agent by Chris Aniszczyk. Later, I also did a live demo of kagent to help me with Istio ambient operations.

### 🇯🇵 OpenSSF Community – Japan

I connected with the open source security community in Japan to explore how agentic AI can help shape the future of cloud-native users, OpenSSF, and the broader open source ecosystem. I also showcased a live demo of kagent, highlighting the future impact of agentic AI.

### 🇺🇸Open Source Summit NA

In a totally unplanned moment, I did a live demo of kagent alongside my generative AI application with Kubernetes, Argo and Istio—right in the middle of troubleshooting a Git mistake I had just made! 😅

It was amazing to have kagent acting like my buddy on stage, offering hints and helping me recover in real time. A great example of how powerful and practical agentic AI can be!

## Beyond Cloud Native Operations

While kagent was originally designed to tackle challenges in cloud-native operations, we've been excited to see users applying it far beyond that scope.

Thanks to its knowledge-based agent, kagent can be used to interact with and reason over any type of documentation—not just Kubernetes manifests or infrastructure logs. From internal wikis and runbooks to software manuals and onboarding guides, kagent is proving to be a powerful tool for making structured and unstructured knowledge accessible via simple conversations.

## 🎉Wrapping Up

To everyone who has starred the kagent repo, contributed code, filed issues, joined discussions, or simply helped spread the word—**thank you** for being an essential part of this community! We’re super excited to keep growing and building together.

Let’s shape the future of Agentic AI with kagent—together!
